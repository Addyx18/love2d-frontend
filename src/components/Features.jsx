          <p>
            If you get stuck, many friendly people are ready to help you at the
            forums. Be warned, however, that it sometimes gets too friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            People also post their games and projects on the forums, so it's a
            nice way of exploring what LÖVE can do. Or at least what people
            choose to use it for.

          <p>There is also a Discord server and a subreddit.</p>
